# Car-Data-Analysis

In today's data-driven world, understanding and harnessing the power of data is paramount. The ability to analyze and derive meaningful insights from vast datasets has become a critical skill in various domains, including business, healthcare, finance, and more. In this comprehensive data analysis and machine learning project, we delve into a dataset containing valuable information about vehicles, exploring a wide range of data preprocessing, visualization, and modeling techniques.

Our journey begins by importing essential libraries and loading the dataset, which includes details about different car models, their specifications, and prices. We meticulously examine the dataset's structure, revealing the data types, summary statistics, and missing values. To ensure data integrity, we handle duplicates and missing values, making informed decisions about which columns to retain and which to drop.

One crucial aspect of data analysis is dealing with outliers that can skew our results. We employ the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to identify and remove outliers, ensuring our dataset is robust and reliable. Next, we explore the market share of car brands, uncovering the most represented brands and their average prices, shedding light on consumer preferences.

Further enhancing our analysis, we delve into the correlation matrix to understand relationships between variables and visualize them through a heatmap. With exploratory data analysis, we examine the distribution of transmission types, vehicle styles, and sales trends over the years, uncovering valuable insights into consumer behavior and market dynamics.

Our project also includes machine learning aspects, where we prepare the dataset for modeling by encoding categorical variables and performing feature scaling. We split the data into training and test sets, paving the way for building predictive models.

This project serves as a comprehensive guide for anyone interested in data analysis and machine learning, demonstrating how to navigate real-world datasets, clean and preprocess data, and derive meaningful insights using visualization and modeling techniques. Whether you're a data enthusiast, analyst, or aspiring data scientist, this project provides a hands-on experience in leveraging data to make informed decisions and predictions.
